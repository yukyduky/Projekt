What techniques to implement:

CORE TECHNIQUES(1):
Deferred Rendering\n
Skeletal Animation (om vi får tid över)

GEOMETRY(2):
Parsing and rendering an existing model format
Displacement mapping using tessellation hardware
Height-map terrain rendering, user can walk on the terrain using WASD keys.
Level of detail using tessellation hardware
Morph-based vertex animation

TEXTURING AND LIGHTING(1):
Normal mapping
Screen space ambient occlusion
Blend mapping(multi-texturing)

PROJECTION TECHNIQUES(1):
Shadow mapping
Shadow volumes
Dynamic cubic environment mapping
Dynamic paraboloid mapping

ACCELERATION TECHNIQUES(2):
View frustum culling against a quadtree
Front to back rendering
Occlusion culling
Back face culling using geometry shader

OTHER TECHNIQUES(2):
Particle systems with billboarded particles
Gaussian filter
Bilateral filter
Mouse picking
Screen-space antialiasing
Water-effect
Glow-effect
Solve any technique listed in this category using compute shaders(counts as 2!)
Make a small game in your application
