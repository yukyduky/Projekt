# Projekt
DirectX

What techniques to implement:

MANDATORY TECHNIQUES(all):
✓You have to use a "perspective" camera
You have to use textures in your 3D models
You have to implement ambient, diffuse and specular lighting
✓You have to implement a first-person camera movement
  use "w-a-s-d" for moving and the mouse to look around.
Using a Geometry shader is not mandatory, but recommended.
At the end, you will submit the project and also a written report in English describing each of the techniques you have implemented.
The english language is not graded in any way, so do not worry but use a spellchecker.

CORE TECHNIQUES(1):
✓Deferred Rendering*
Skeletal Animation (om vi får tid över)

GEOMETRY(2):
Parsing and rendering an existing model format
Displacement mapping using tessellation hardware
Height-map terrain rendering, user can walk on the terrain using WASD keys*
Level of detail using tessellation hardware*
Morph-based vertex animation

TEXTURING AND LIGHTING(1):
✓Normal mapping*
Screen space ambient occlusion
Blend mapping(multi-texturing)

PROJECTION TECHNIQUES(1):
Shadow mapping*(någon av denna eller shadow volume när vi har mer info)
Shadow volumes*
Dynamic cubic environment mapping
Dynamic paraboloid mapping

ACCELERATION TECHNIQUES(2):
View frustum culling against a quadtree (hittar inte vettig info vad det är)*
Front to back rendering*
Occlusion culling
Back face culling using geometry shader

OTHER TECHNIQUES(2):
Particle systems with billboarded particles
Gaussian filter
Bilateral filter 
Mouse picking*
Screen-space antialiasing (kolla upp mer exakt vad det är)
Water-effect
Glow-effect
Solve any technique listed in this category using compute shaders(counts as 2!)
Make a small game in your application
